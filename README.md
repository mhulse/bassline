## About

Essentially, this code serves as a "local" baseline grid toolkit for use in other css projects.

### What is a baseline?

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_%28typography%29) says:

> â€¦ the baseline is the line upon which most letters "sit" and below which descenders extend.

### What is a "global" baseline grid?

A "global" baseline grid (or, "document-based" baseline grid) consists of applying a grid to the document's `<body>` and then aligning all the text to a vertical grid, set in even increments all the way down the page, where the bottom of each letter is positioned onto the grid, just like writing on lined paper.

### What is a "local" baseline grid?

A "local" baseline grid is exactly like the above, except the grid gets applied directly to "modules", "content areas" or elements and the alignment happens relative to the application of the vertical grid.

### Why use a "local" baseline?

While a "global" baseline grid might work well in print, on the web there are numerous situations where baseline grid alignment isn't practical.

Using a "local" baseline allows the developer to focus on the baseline grid alignment for a particular "module", "content area" or element whilst relieving the pressure to maintain baseline alignment between the aforementioned items.

The goal is to use a "local" baseline (and the math that powers it) as a quick and easy way to add vertical "meaning" to a page's content (much in the same way that a "horizontal" grid (rows/cols) gives "meaning" to a page's layout).

### Why "Rex"?

Just watch **[Rustlers' Rhapsody](http://amzn.to/19CUPdE)** ([Amazon VOD](http://amzn.to/18PXwre)) and all will be explained. :)

**Note:** Only the [`DEVELOPMENT` demo](http://mhulse.github.io/rex/demo/) uses [`normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## Installation

There are several ways to install this code:

1. Download as a [`zip`](https://github.com/mhulse/rex/archive/gh-pages.zip).
1. Clone it: `$ git clone https://github.com/mhulse/rex.git`.
1. Fork it and clone: `$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/rex.git`.
1. Just grab the [relevant CSS](https://raw.github.com/mhulse/rex/gh-pages/demo/rex.css) ([minified](https://raw.github.com/mhulse/rex/gh-pages/demo/rex.min.css)).
1. Using [Bower](http://bower.io/): `$ bower install https://github.com/mhulse/rex.git`.

### Build process:

In order to build from source, you'll need to install [Grunt.js: The JavaScript Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/).

From there, `$ cd source/` and run `$ npm install`; after the [dependencies](https://github.com/mhulse/rex/blob/gh-pages/source/package.json) have been installed, run `$ grunt bower` (this installs [`normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as a [Bower](http://bower.io/) dependency).

For subsequent builds, just run `$ grunt`; this default task will generate or copy files, based on the [`Gruntfile.js`](https://github.com/mhulse/rex/blob/gh-pages/source/Gruntfile.js) configuration and files found in the `/source` folder, into the `/demo` folder.

## SCSS API

Available SCSS overrides:

### Variables:

`$NS` | Namespace prefix. | `rex_`
`$font-size-base` | Base `font-size`. | `16px`
`$line-height-base` | Base `line-height`. | `24px` 

### Functions
