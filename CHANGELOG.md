# Changelog

## v1.1.0

#### September 15, 2013

* Rearranged folder structure:
	* Now <b>only</b> demo files live in `/demo` folder.
	* Moved important files into `/rex`.
		* On top of min/un-min generated CSS files, I've copied the SCSS files into this location as well; this should allow Bower installs to easily grab what's needed and easily ignore what's not needed.
	* In `/source/files/styles`, the SCSS partials have been moved into `partials/`.
* Several other small changes too numerous to mention.

## v1.0.0

#### September 13, 2013

* Official release.
